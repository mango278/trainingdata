[Intro]
Cold when it's critical
Cool  but cynical
Maxed  out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical

Nobody don't trust nobody 'round here
What, welcome to London

[Verse 1]
So when I step to the high road
I see CCTV and cameras
They goin' hard for the riches and fortunes
From the street vendors to the bankers
Boys in blue always lookin' for a problem
There’s a price to pay when you’re a Black man
There’s a next one pressurin' both sides
He don’t give a fuck, and we call him the taxman (Yo)
So welcome to London fam
Poverty we got it in abundance fam
Some are homeless, some are reckless
You'll get fucked if you buck up on a London gang
Watch sterling a run up in your London grands
Put work in and mash up all ya London plans
Ya can't argue when they start charge you
Congestion that's another London scam

[Pre-Chorus]
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal

[Verse 2]
Flexin', but slowly we’re sufferin'
On his name round ya see man covetin'
We go hard but we know we been a likkle
But the ego don’t show where we strugglin'
Cold even through we got the teapot bubblin'
Youngas on the roadside they do the hustlin'
So the street crimes always epidemic and ya could
Find a real killer in the club shufflin' (Yo)
So welcome to London fam
Black cabs, red busses and the white van man
They got oysters, they not just seafood
So the boy dem can follow and see you
24 hours every day my city don’t sleep
You need P’s in my city 'cause its not cheap
Top quality has never been a guarantee
We'll extort you, your friends and family


[Pre-Chorus]
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal
That's how we function
Cold when it's critical
Cool but cynical
Maxed out never minimal

[Outro]
What the fuck d'you mean next week?

So fuck off, find my money, come back
Put it in me hand and then fuck off
Welcome to London ya mug

Say dem ah big man but they won't get far
Without Jah, dem nah reach far

[Verse 2: Flowdan]
War
You know my name and me know me love war
Run from anyone? We'll stand up and fight, war
Coulda fist fight, knife stab, any war
War, could a fist fight knife stab any war
Well if I want war, pass me the SLR
Load and cock that, buss it inna by Jah
Dress up inna black when man ah fight war
You know my name and me know me love war

Bring di two of dem when you come inna di war, yeah
So what you reckon inna war?
Without Jah, you won't last a second in a war

[Break: Flowdan]
And that's why they will burn
They couldn't listen and they couldn't learn
When it comes to di war
Your face could get scarred and wet up like a perm
That's not my concern
Man roll with Jah

[Verse 3: Flowdan]
How long will I live? When will I die?
Is there a heaven or was that a lie?
Let me tell you something: I don't really mind
Just as long as I'm here, I'll kill dat with style
Whether it's now or near future
Make sure you bury me with the shooter
Bulletproof vest and my silencer
When I go to the grave, I'll keep it gangsta
Six foot deep, coffin and wreath
Bun the devil and all ah kill dutty beast
Big war ah gwan between north and east
So watch your neck back, protect your head, please
Please, my yout, unnu try live clean
But do your own ting and smoke a lil' bit weed
Before your start smoke, separate your seed
Jah Rastafari bless you and me

[Outro: Flowdan]
Yeah
Stop chat 'bout war
If you don't know 'bout the meaning of war
You see Flowdan and The Bug?
We represent Jah
No guy test
Boom

One shot, two shot, three shot, clear
And you know that we got a transit spare
Case we gotta run up on your rear
Man don't care if you go gym and UNO
Or if you rock Moncler
Talking tough? Man might call that bluff
Then next thing you know, you disappear
Dear oh dear, I don't wanna hear no he said, she said
He's gonna do that, my G, you're on ket
Badboy on the internet
But in real life, manaman know that you're just wet
Talk out the side of your mout, but one thing I know
My name, you're gonna respect
Violation or wasting my time
You already know that's something I won't let
Man wanna go on like some Musketeer
Talk about P, my P, you're not near
500 when I step into gear
Look in the rear view, don, you're not there
Ten years plus, yo, I know it's not fair
And I'll do another ten, I can see clear
I'm on a different page
Two seventeen, I'm on a different wave

Babe, quick, get that phone call
If that strap's got sixteen bullets
Man gon' get that total
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
Greaze, greaze, greaze
It's that kid that flipped that token
Grabbed that, left that broken
It's that kid that lit that spliff
What, Biz, what? Get that potion
It's that kid that knocked that door
What? Knock-knock, kicked that open
Greaze, greaze, please
Leave man, please
Man just crept and tiptoed and hold 'em
Clip the prick that's been chosen
Man just lit the pricks up and smoke 'em
Man get lifted and soaken
Man get gassed up off all this social
Man's got big shit in motion
Man's too sick to be loafing, joking
Man's too big to be boasting
