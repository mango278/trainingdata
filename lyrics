Baddadan, baddadan, baddadan
Anywhere we see dem, we ah bang pon another one
Buss up four five nanko and Remington
Any boy diss Balla, turn him inna skeleton
Badman you know wi vibes can't dun
Vibes can't dun, wi kill ah sound boy fi fun
Big bad man from outta England
Bassline drop ah tear the whole place down

[Refrain: Takura]
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we

[Verse 2: Trigga]
Baddadan, baddadan, baddadan
Bad from me born
Where you get your badda from?
Ting weh me get could ah come from Afghanistan
They don't wanna see this raas mic me have inna me hand
Badda man, you know me vibes can't done
Lyrics them a firе like a bullet from ah gun
Big badda man from outta England
When mе lyrics start fire, watch a sound boy run

[Verse 3: Flowdan]
Yo, walk with the rupa-pum-pum
From a guy diss the programme, shot a slam-slam
Dem say dem a badman, mi haffi ark which one
When we ah fire shot, pull pin and fling bomb
Dem dead, we haffi trample dem like King Kong
Dargs pull up at your foot and none of dem nah sing-song
Balaclava pon face, 'matic inna hand
We nah have time fi waste with the rupa-pum-pum
Shot a slam, we badda dan

[Refrain: Takura]
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we
Nobody badder than we
